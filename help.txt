    a. Using a small # of trials (<1000) will result in high variance of results
    b. Increasing the # of trials will result in lower variance but increase simulation time.
    c. Toggle the "Plot % History" checkbox in bottom-left area to visualize the variance of the results.
    
4. Once simulation settings are configured, press the "Run" button to perform the simulation.
    a. When simulation is complete the Win/Loss/Tie percentages should be updated and an optional graph will popup.

5. To save a simulation press the "Save" button and enter a name for the file.

6. To load a previously saved simulation press the "Load" button and select the desired file.

7. To generate a report summary of all the hands simulated so far press the "Report" button.
